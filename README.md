# Intro
Java 8 training exercises made with love for my team mates and co-workers.

# How to complete the exercises
Clone this repository, open it with your favourite IDE and implement all the methods from `Lambdas`, `Streams`, `Optionals` and `Time` classes while passing the unit tests.

# Retrospective
It would be helpful to run a retrospective meeting among the co-workers who have finished the exercises to discuss the proposed solutions.
